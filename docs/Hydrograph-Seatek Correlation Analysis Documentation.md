"""Title: Hydrograph-Seatek Cross-Correlation Analysis ScriptAuthor: Abhi MehrotraDate: December 2024Description:This script analyzes the relationship between hydrograph discharge measurements and Seatek sensorreadings across multiple river miles. It generates visualizations and calculates correlationcoefficients to understand how changes in river discharge relate to sensor measurements.Technical Overview:------------------The script processes data from multiple Excel files containing hydrograph discharge (gpm) andSeatek sensor readings (mm) for various river miles. For each river mile and sensor combination,it generates time series visualizations and calculates Pearson correlation coefficients.Key Components:1. Data Processing   - Reads data from Excel files organized by river mile   - Cleans data by removing zeros, negative values, and outliers   - Organizes data by year for temporal analysis2. Visualization   - Creates dual-axis plots showing:     * Hydrograph discharge (blue dots, left y-axis)     * Seatek sensor readings (orange line with points, right y-axis)   - Includes correlation statistics and data point count   - Saves high-resolution PNG files for each analysis3. Statistical Analysis   - Calculates Pearson correlation coefficients   - Provides interpretation of correlation strength   - Tracks number of paired observations (n)Understanding Correlation Analysis:---------------------------------The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) measures the strength and direction of the linearrelationship between hydrograph discharge and sensor readings:Range Interpretation:* -1.0 to -0.9: Very strong negative correlation* -0.9 to -0.7: Strong negative correlation* -0.7 to -0.5: Moderate negative correlation* -0.5 to -0.3: Weak negative correlation* -0.3 to 0.0:  Very weak to no negative correlation*  0.0 to 0.3:  Very weak to no positive correlation*  0.3 to 0.5:  Weak positive correlation*  0.5 to 0.7:  Moderate positive correlation*  0.7 to 0.9:  Strong positive correlation*  0.9 to 1.0:  Very strong positive correlationCorrelation Formula:r = Σ((x - x̄)(y - ȳ)) / √(Σ(x - x̄)² * Σ(y - ȳ)²)where:- x: Hydrograph discharge values- y: Seatek sensor readings- x̄, ȳ: Mean values of x and y respectivelyResults Analysis:----------------Initial findings from River Mile 54.0 show:1. Year 1:   - Sensor 1: r = 0.24 (n=25 points)     * Indicates a weak positive correlation     * Suggests limited direct relationship between discharge and sensor readings   - Sensor 2: r = 0.17 (n=43 points)     * Very weak positive correlation     * More data points but weaker relationship2. Year 2:   - Both sensors: r = 0.40 (n varies)     * Weak to moderate positive correlation     * Stronger relationship than Year 1     * Suggests possible improvement in sensor responseInterpretation:--------------1. Correlation Strength:   - Weak to moderate correlations (0.17-0.40) suggest that while there is some relationship     between hydrograph discharge and sensor readings, other factors likely influence the     measurements   - The stronger correlation in Year 2 might indicate:     * Improved sensor calibration     * Different environmental conditions     * Better data collection methods2. Sample Size (n):   - Varying sample sizes affect confidence in correlations   - Larger n (e.g., n=43 for Sensor 2) provides more reliable correlation estimates   - Smaller n (e.g., n=8) suggests need for more data collection3. Environmental Considerations:   - Weak correlations might be due to:     * Time lag between discharge changes and sensor response     * Local environmental factors affecting sensor readings     * Potential sensor calibration issues     * Complex hydrological patterns not captured by linear correlationUsage Notes:-----------1. File Requirements:   - Excel files must be in specified format   - Data_Summary.xlsx for river mile information   - Individual RM_*.xlsx files for each river mile2. Output:   - Visualizations saved in output/RM_*/ directories   - Console output provides processing details and statistics3. Error Handling:   - Robust error checking for data quality   - Detailed error messages for troubleshooting   - Skips problematic data while continuing processingFuture Enhancements:------------------1. Additional Analysis:   - Time-lagged correlation analysis   - Seasonal trend analysis   - Multiple regression for environmental factors2. Visualization Options:   - Interactive plotting capabilities   - Additional statistical measures   - Customizable plot parameters3. Data Processing:   - Additional data cleaning options   - Support for different file formats   - Batch processing capabilitiesDependencies:------------- Python 3.10+- pandas- numpy- matplotlib- seaborn- pathlibFor questions or support, contact:[abhimhrtr@pm.me]"""
